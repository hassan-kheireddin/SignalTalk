## About the Project

The **Minitalk** project involves building a client-server system where:
- The server can receive messages from a client.
- The client sends messages character by character to the server using UNIX signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`).

This project enhances understanding of:
- Low-level UNIX signal handling.
- Synchronous and asynchronous communication.
- Converting and transferring data using bitwise operations.

---

## Features

- **Signal-based Communication:** Uses `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` for transferring data.
- **Message Handling:** Transmits messages from the client to the server.
- **Custom Encoding:** Each character is encoded into binary and sent bit by bit.
- **Reliable Communication:** Handles signal acknowledgment to ensure successful delivery.
